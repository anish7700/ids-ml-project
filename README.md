# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a RandomForest-based IDS using the NSL-KDD dataset. It covers:
- Data preprocessing (scaling + one-hot encoding)
- Model training & evaluation
- Simulated traffic predictions
- Basic real-time sniffing illustration

## Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
